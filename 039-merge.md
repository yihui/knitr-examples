This demo shows you how to merge the source and output blocks in markdown output. Note **knitr** puts R source and output in separate blocks by default.


``` r
a = 1
a
```

```
## [1] 1
```

``` r
b = 1:10
write(b, "")
```

```
## 1 2 3 4 5
## 6 7 8 9 10
```

See if the chunk option `collapse` works:


``` r
a = 1
a
## [1] 1
b = 1:10
write(b, "")
## 1 2 3 4 5
## 6 7 8 9 10
```

Source and output lived together happily ever in **knitr**.
