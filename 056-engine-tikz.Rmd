Description
-----------

The engine inserts the code into a latex-string-template, which is then processed by `pdflatex` -- and `convert` (if `dev` is not `pdf`). 

Sometimes you have to adjust the latex-string-template to load some required
latex-packages. By default, `.tikz2pdf.tex.st` will be available in the current
working directory after the first call to `knit`. 


Options
-------

You can pass some options to the engine by defining `engine.opts`. By default it is defined as: 

```r
engine.opts = list(
   ,repl.tmpl = ".tikz2pdf.tex.st" # Latex-string template file 
       ## The code is inserted into this file; if it is not existing it will be
       ## generated; depending on your purpose and language you have to define
       ## some latex-packages in there. 
    repl.st = "<>"  # String to replace in template-file
```

Example
-------

An example of the tikz-engine from <https://raw.github.com/sdiehl/cats/master/misc/example.md>

```{r tikz-ex, echo = FALSE, engine = "tikz", fig.cap = "Funky tikz", dev = 'pdf'}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm, auto,>=latex', thick, scale = 0.5]
\node (P) {$P$};
\node (B) [right of=P] {$B$};
\node (A) [below of=P] {$A$};
\node (C) [below of=B] {$C$};
\node (P1) [node distance=1.4cm, left of=P, above of=P] {$\hat{P}$};
\draw[->] (P) to node {$f$} (B);
\draw[->] (P) to node [swap] {$g$} (A);
\draw[->] (A) to node [swap] {$f$} (C);
\draw[->] (B) to node {$g$} (C);
\draw[->, bend right] (P1) to node [swap] {$\hat{g}$} (A);
\draw[->, bend left] (P1) to node {$\hat{f}$} (B);
\draw[->, dashed] (P1) to node {$k$} (P);
\end{tikzpicture}
```   

Tips
----

To develop the tikz-code, you could use `qtikz` or `ktikz`.
