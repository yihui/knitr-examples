# Different cache levels

`cache=FALSE` or `cache=0` means no cache:


```r
Sys.sleep(1)
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
plot(cars)
```

`cache=1` means to save the results from `evaluate::evaluate()`, and pretend
the code has been evaluated; all the output hooks will be applied every time
the document is recompiled; note the plots are also saved as display lists,
and will be redrawn every time the document is recompiled:


```r
Sys.sleep(1)
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
plot(cars)
```

![plot of chunk test-cache-b](https://db.yihui.org/knitr-examples/figure/101-cache-levels-test-cache-b-1.png)

`cache=2` is similar to `cache=1`, and the only difference is that the plots
will not be redrawn, in which case you need to make sure you did not delete
the figure files manually:


```r
Sys.sleep(1)
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
plot(cars)
```

![plot of chunk test-cache-c](https://db.yihui.org/knitr-examples/figure/101-cache-levels-test-cache-c-1.png)

`cache=TRUE` or `cache=3` means to cache the text output of a chunk; none of
the output hooks will be called when the document is recompiled, and the
plots will not be redrawn, either:


```r
Sys.sleep(1)
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
plot(cars)
```

![plot of chunk test-cache-d](https://db.yihui.org/knitr-examples/figure/101-cache-levels-test-cache-d-1.png)

Below is a test case for [#588](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/588):


```r
pairs(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 100), labels = 1:100, pch = ".")
```

![plot of chunk test-cache-e](https://db.yihui.org/knitr-examples/figure/101-cache-levels-test-cache-e-1.png)

Another test case, with more plots:


```r
Sys.sleep(5)
plot(1:10)
abline(0, 1)
```

![plot of chunk test-cache-f](https://db.yihui.org/knitr-examples/figure/101-cache-levels-test-cache-f-1.png)

```r
plot(2:11)
```
