# An example for `purl()`

The function `purl()` can be used to extract code chunks from a document.


```r
1+1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
strsplit('hello world', ' ')
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "hello" "world"
```

A second chunk.


```r
if (FALSE) plot(1:10)
```

When we do not evaluate a chunk, the code from `purl()` will be commented out.


```r
paste(letters, collapse = '|')
if (1 == 1) {
  'Awesome!'
}
```

If one chunk should not be included in the results from `purl()`, just use the chunk option `purl = FALSE`:


```r
# we do not like significance stars!
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE, show.signif.stars = FALSE)
```

That is it.
