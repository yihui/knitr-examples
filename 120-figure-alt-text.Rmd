```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# simulate pandoc html output
knitr::opts_knit$set(rmarkdown.pandoc.to = "html")
```

An alternative text will always be provided with an image tag in html. 

By default, the caption will be used

```{r, fig.cap = "A caption"}
plot(1:10)
```

You can use an alt text different than a caption using `fig.alt`

```{r, fig.cap = "A caption", fig.alt = "An alternative text"}
plot(1:10)
```


It will be evaluated after the chunk like `fig.cap`

```{r, fig.cap = sprintf("%s points", n), fig.alt = sprintf("A graph with %s points", n)}
n <- 15
plot(1:n)
```

And recycled if several graphs

```{r, fig.cap = "A caption", fig.alt = "An alternative text"}
plot(1:15)
plot(1:10)
```

or you can pass a vector

```{r, fig.cap = "Fig1", fig.alt = c("Alt1", "Alt2"), fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:15)
plot(1:10)
```
