# Include external images

You can call the function `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk to embed external images. This function works for all types of **knitr** source documents, such as Rnw and Rmd. Below is a simple example:

```{r}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('figure/003-minimal-fancy-rgl-1.png')
```

You can pass a character vector of mutiple image paths to `include_graphics()`, and you can also use chunk options related to figures, such as `out.width` and `fig.cap`, etc.
