# Include external images

You can call the function `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk to embed external images. This function works for all types of **knitr** source documents, such as Rnw and Rmd. Below is a simple example:

```{r}
library(knitr)
include_graphics('figure/003-minimal-fancy-rgl-1.png', dpi = NA)
```

You can pass a character vector of mutiple image paths to `include_graphics()`, and you can also use chunk options related to figures, such as `out.width` and `fig.cap`, etc.

# Some tests

Below are some tests for the PR https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1776.

## Three graphics in the same chunk

```{r, include=FALSE}
# A hack that you should not look at!
knitr::opts_knit$set(rmarkdown.pandoc.to = 'html')
```

```{r}
images = c(
  "figure/001-minimal-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png",
  "figure/001-minimal-unnamed-chunk-2-2.png",
  "figure/003-minimal-html-cars-scatter-2.png"
)
```

Using three times `include_graphics()`:

```{r, fig.cap = "This is a caption", out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(images[1])
knitr::include_graphics(images[2])
knitr::include_graphics(images[3])
```

```{r, fig.cap = "This is another caption", out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(images)
```

## Mixing with R plots

```{r, mix-a, fig.cap = "This is a caption", out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(images[1])
plot(cars)
knitr::include_graphics(images[2])
1 + 1
knitr::include_graphics(images[3])
```

```{r, mix-b, fig.cap = c("This is a caption", "This is another", "this is a plot", "And a last"), out.width = "33%"}
knitr::include_graphics(images[1:2])
plot(cars)
1 + 1
knitr::include_graphics(images[3])
```

## Placing caption at the top

```{r, fig.cap = "This is a caption", out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.topcaption = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(images[1])
knitr::include_graphics(images[2])
knitr::include_graphics(images[3])
```

```{r, fig.cap = "This is another caption", out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.topcaption = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(images)
```
