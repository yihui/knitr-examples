# My report

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

This example shows how to generate chunk labels dynamically with the brew syntax. It was motivated by the SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/q/12095113/559676

```{r create-iterator, include=FALSE}
src = NULL
pat_brew()  # use brew syntax first
knit_hooks$set(inline = identity)

for (cur.cyl in unique(mtcars$cyl)) {
  src = c(src, knit(text = readLines('041-label-i-child.tpl')))
}

# continue with markdown syntax and hooks
pat_md()
render_markdown()
# knit the generated R markdown source
out = knit(text = src)
```

## Generate report for each level of cylinder variable

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat(out, sep = '\n')
```
